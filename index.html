<h2>3. advice</h2>
<h1>It is good that you wish to join god's side. As he loves you more then anyone else.
  Be happy for life. Be happy with the things you have. Always help and be respectful. Treat even a bird in the sky as a brother/sister, like your family. You are not more or less mattering then any other being. Besides god.
And the reason its good you wish to join god's side is because god offers you eternal happiness, peace and positivity for the afterlife. And that is called heaven. And do not think you are too far from god. Being too far from god is not a thing. If you have the heart to even accept god. You will be forgiven.
And if you sin a lot or not much. It doesn't matter all too much, we all stumble at times. To fix the fact you sinned. pray to god for forgiveness, and if you really regret your sin. he will forgive. And dont think you can lie to god. God knows everything,
and he will know when you are lying or not. He will know when you are hiding something. So if you lie a lot, first of all stop it. Second of all just give god honest answers at all times. He will be happy with your honesty. But he will dislike your lies.
